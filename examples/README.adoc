== Table of Contents

> petstoreToc.pdf

Asciidoctor can automatically generate a table of contents for you.

    Swagger2PDF -i spec/petstore.yaml -o petstoreToc.pdf -t

== RegEx grouping

> petstoreRegex.pdf

The plugin can group operations using Regular Expressions.
This allows you to introduce a custom structure to the document.
We also included a table of contents in this example, to clearly display the structure.

The first capture group will be used to group operations together, make sure that it isn't unique to each operation because then you'll end up with a lot of categories.

    Swagger2PDF -i spec/petstore.yaml -o petstoreRegex.pdf -r \/(\w+)\/.*$ -t
